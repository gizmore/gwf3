# CGX#0: Intro

Hello and welcome to @codinggeex.
We are gizmore, rain and x from wechall,
and we want to share knowledge about programming,
hacking (not so much cracking) and other
IT relevant topics.

In the end, we hope to teach people to make the world a better place.

## CGX Crew

Some people might call us
[hackers](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html)
, and maybe that is true to some point.
