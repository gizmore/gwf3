# CGX#1: PHP + Eclipse

This is our first lesson.
We show how to setup an IDE(Integrated Development Environment)
on a windows desktop machine.
We will code in PHP, with the Eclipse IDE, and install a debugger,
so we can really solve and tackle complex programs later.
I will also present my own work in PHP one day,
which i plan to migrate to a new language then.

So - who are we?
