# CGX#12: PHPStorm

[PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
is a highly professional
[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
[IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
working on most OS.

Others stand no change against the product from house
[Jetbeain](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

After bigger and bigger challenges, disappointments, and limitations,
despite being very familiar in Eclipse,
I really had to give PHPStorm a chance; and it is a **breathtaking** experience.

In this video we discuss Jetbrains wording and explore the most outstanding and useful features of this fabulous IDE.

Ir is the best programming software i have ever used,
and definately it *is* the **best** PHP IDE on planet earth. - Their own slogan!

It leaves almost no wishes open, and to repharase it, i was and am still baffled a lot.

To me it feels like a whole new world...

Amazing Work! - gizmore


## CGX#12 PHPStorm: License

The license and *paywall*(?) always made PHPStorm a no-go for me, but this is **NOT** the case.
There are very fleixble license models, which are totally fair.

 - Preview (maybe re-new?)
 - Lifelong (every licensed version)
 - Monthly (Two IDEs)
 - Personal (fair)
 - Company (fair)
 - Commercial use allowed (always)
 - Reasonable EULA (your data seems good)
 

## CGX#12 PHPStorm: Wording

Some general PHPStorm terminalogy.

 - `Indentions` - Code Whitespaces
 - `Inspections` - Code Validators
 - `Formatting` - All of that!
 - `Completion` - Source generation
 - `Refactoring` - Code alterations
 
 - `Excluded` - No Formatting, ...?
 - `SourceRoot` - But Completion!
