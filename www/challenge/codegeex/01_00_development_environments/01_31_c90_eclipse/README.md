# CGX#: Eclipse and C90 on Windows

Here we will install GCC via MinGW and Eclipse CDT,
on a windows desktop, and **of course** we want a working debugger again.

As a demo, we will also implement `/bin/grr` from our todo - 
a C/++ binary that applies a `preg_replace()` to all lines from stdin to stdout.

It is similiar to `awk` / `sed`,
but it can only do that one thing very well.


## Installation
