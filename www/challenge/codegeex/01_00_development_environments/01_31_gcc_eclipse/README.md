# CGX#: Eclipse and C90/C++ on Windows

Here we will install gcc and Eclipse CDT on a windows desktop.

Of course we want a working debugger.

As a demo, we are implementing `/bin/grr`.

A C/++ binary that applies a *preg_replace* from stdin to stdout.

It is similiar to awk/sed, but can only do this one thing well.

## Installation

 - [git4windows]()
 - cygwin?
 - [Eclipse C-DevTools / CDT]()
 - [GnuCompilerCollection / GCC]()
