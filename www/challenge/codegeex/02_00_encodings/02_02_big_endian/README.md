# CGX#16: Big Endian

Everything is binary; just 0 and 1.
But, it is a matter of taste if the
[ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture)
on your CPU has an
[endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)
of 
LE(LittleEndian)
or
BE(BigEndian).

----

Imagine a nibble (4 bits) in LE and BE.

8421 (LE values of bits)

0001 == 1 (LittleEndian)

1248 (BE values of bits)

0001 = 8 (BigEndian)
