# CGX#14: Amaze Me

In this lesson we will use [x64debug](https://x64dbg.com/)
to crack a windows application [AmazeMe](https://www.wechall.net/download/30/amazeme_exe),
designed to learn cracking and assembly.
It has no anti debugger tricks, is slim and beautiful.
The crackit was designed by bb. All kudos to him.
