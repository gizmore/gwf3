# CGX#: Cracking Introduction - Downloading Video Streams 

This is meant as a mild introduction to the infamous cats and mouse game, called cracking.

It gets harder and harder to download, often semi-illegal, video streams.
In most european countries it seems still to be grayzone to stream any content,
unless you do it for your private use,
and do not save the video.
Your's country's law might vary!
However, it is way more convinient to download it,
to avoid buffering suprises after a few minutes.

Here we will discuss how the game evolved for this particular problem.
