# CGX#6: Functions and Variables

In this video we talk quickly about the most 
essential and basic things in programming,
so you hear a few technical terms already.

Again we are using PHP, but we will start with machine code soon :D

And... no worries, you will probably learn about all this more later, by some examples and better languages.

 - Enjoy!
