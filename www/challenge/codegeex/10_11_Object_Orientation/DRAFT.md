# CGX#11 - Object Orientation

## Now what is OOP?

It focuses on manipulating objects,
which are a collection of variables, and methods,
similiar to a struct.
A struct has no methods. OOP, classes and stuff,
add methods to them.

## Draft

 - class
 - accessabilty (public, protected, private)
 - member variables and methods
 - static variables and methods
 - extends
 - interfaces
 - traits
