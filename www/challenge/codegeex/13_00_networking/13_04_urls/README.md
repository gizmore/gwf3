# CGX#13: urls

In this lesson we talk about urls.

I have hidden a few inside this
[markdown](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html)
document, and you probably know already what an
[URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL?rel=gizmore)
or
[Uniform](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-a-url)
[Resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL)
[Locator](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/URL)
is...

It is used in e.g. links to access ressources,
which is just an URL with a text, like this:

[https://mp3:gizmore@google.de:443/q?s=gizmore&x#amir](https://mp3:gizmore@google.de:443/q?s=gizmore&x#amir)

To demonstrate it, the text here equals the link.

Anyway, i am sure some
[newbies](https://memes.com/m/KwEZ9D8eR8V)
will learn something,
and some of us would 
[call](tel:017659598844)
this a

from the
[past](https://remix.kwed.org/download.php/4242/SkyMarshall%20Arts%20-%20Abyss%20Game%202%20%28Emulate%20the%20Past%20mix%29.mp3).

### Why ?

Why did they use 2 different characters
for the query part of the url? (`?` and `&`)?

This complicates url a lot.
