# CGX: phpgdo

In this video i describe what the phpgdo framework is.

 - started with gwf3/wechall.net
 - gdo6 was still bad
 - finally phpgdo v7 php8.2
 - mysql required
 - scalar type hinting
 - very dry and lazy
 - security concepts
 - zero dependencies
 - *NOT* MVC
 - composer for unit tests
 - nodejs + yarn for www
 - zero cost modularity
 - 3rd party modules always source
 - dev pipeline and production builds
 - render modes
 - Questions?
 - Comparison?
