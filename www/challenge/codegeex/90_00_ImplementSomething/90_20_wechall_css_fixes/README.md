We will look for the worst problems and enhance the Site a bit.
This is a task that i should have done years ago. Sry!
Well, we apply some bugfixes, and read the **ugly** codebase a bit.

I explain what is bad, and how my new framework improved on the requirement, and how other frameworks do it.


## WeChall bugfix ToDo

 - editor: textarea padding and style.
 - markup: mobile and aria accessibility.
 - profile: meta description, title and image.
 - editor: fix adding links.
 - challenges: when tag is CGX, show 0scores.
 - bbcode: The `[score=n]` rendering shall indicated that it would be hidden.
