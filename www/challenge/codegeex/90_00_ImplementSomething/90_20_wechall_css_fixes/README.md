# CGX#: wechall.net CSS enhancements

In this video we will install and analyze the
[WeChall](https://www.wechall.net)
website, which is written in 
[gwf3](https://github.com/gizmore/gwf3)
.

We will look for the worst CSS problems and enhance the UI a bit.
This is a task that i should have done years ago. Sry!
Well, we apply some bugfixes, and read the **ugly** codebase a bit.

I explain what is bad, and how my new framework improved on the requirement, and how other frameworks do it.

## WeChall bugfix ToDo

 - textarea padding for editors
 - mobile and aria accessibility
 - meta description, title and image
 - change bbcode to markdown? maybe just fix adding links!
 

### Questions?

Thanks for watching!
