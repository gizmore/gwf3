Hello %s,<br/>
<br/>
You are considering to become a blackhat.<br/>
For some of your activity it might be helpful to use the internet anonymously.<br/>
Your first contractor wants you to use Tor to connect to <a href="https://es-land.net">Edward Snowden Land</a><br/>.
<br/>
Note: The challenge is checking known Tor Exit Nodes.<br/>
You need to register there and connect via Tor at any time.<br/>
When you have connected via Tor you can find your flag in the account settings of ESL.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Challenging!<br/>
