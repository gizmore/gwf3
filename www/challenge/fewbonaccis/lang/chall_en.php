Hello %s,<br/>
<br/>
You and a coworker are arguing about programming, and that fibonacci is solved.<br/>
Your coworker argues that you could not even create a microservice that computes fibbonaci correctly in a reasonable time.<br/>
<br/>
You take the challenge and implement a microservice at your URL below.<br/>
Your microservice will be queried a few times, and each request shall only take 2.618 seconds max.<br/>
Your microservice has to return the md5 of the Nth fibonacci number.<br/>
<br/>
Example: http://your.host.ip/fib.php?n=100 => d8400bceb05dfe785afcd2da4fdb010e
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
