    Hello %s,<br/>
    <br/>
    I proudly present: The <a href="https://github.com/gizmore/pygdo">pygdo</a> chat-bot.<br/>
    I call my new friend &quot;chappy&quot; but it\'s username is often Dog.<br/>
    <br/>
    It currently speaks
    <a href="https://github.com/gizmore/pygdo-telegram">Telegram</a> (<a href="https://t.me/+rankW0nN_ig4OGEy">CLICK</a>),
    <a href="https://github.com/gizmore/pygdo-discord">Discord</a> (<a href="https://discord.gg/ftWTRs3QQG">CLICK</a>),
    <a href="https://github.com/gizmore/pygdo-irc">IRC</a>, (<a href="ircs://irc.wechall.net:6697/#shadowlamb">CLICK</a>)
    WhatsApp (SOON) Bash and HTTP.<br/>
    <br/>
    I have connected GPT-4o to it, and the &quot;AI&quot; can control the bot like a regular user.<br/>
    Like, you can ask chappy to play blackjack and it plays blackjack with the bot.<br/>
    Actually, ...it has super admin cow powers and can even issue $bash commands.<br/>
    You can trigger the bot by starting your messages with &quot;chap&quot; or ending your messages with &quot;chappy&quot;"<br/>
    <br/>
    Example: <blockquote>How are you chappy?</blockquote><br/>
    <br/>
    The AI also knows the password to this ChATTACA challenge, but now you figure out the rest on your own.<br/>
    <br/>
    Shouts go out to quangntenemy for his java bot and tehron for anti bot rules.<br/>
    <br/>
    Good Luck!<br/>
