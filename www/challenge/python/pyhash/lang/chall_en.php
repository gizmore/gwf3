    Hello %s,<br/>
    <br/>
    I am learning python and read the docs a bit.<br/>
    There is not too much challenging material in there, but I got this idea for a little challenge.<br/>
    <code><br/>
    # Your mission is to make this True.
    def fly_away(num: int) -> bool:
        return hash(num) == 31337
    </code><br/>
    Note: This challenge got tested with python3.10 and should be easy.<br/>
    <br/>
    Good luck!<br/>
