Hello %s,<br/>
<br/>
Another TBS-themed challenge.
This one is a quite simple and stupid challenge -
in memory of TBS - which is still available on bright-shadows.net/index2.php<br/>
<br/>
We once recorded a song, Hidden in the Hint, but can you find out who is performing?<br/>
Sadly i could not put the name of this person into the copyright. Please enter the performer\'s name as the solution.<br/>
<br/>
The song and lyrics are available in the %s, but you should also try it on %s.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the song, and...<br/>
Happy Challenging!<br/>
