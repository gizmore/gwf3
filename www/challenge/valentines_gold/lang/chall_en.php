Hello %2$s,<br/>
<br/>
It is Valentine\'s Day and you want to impress your big love, Valentina.<br/>
She is into programming and math, so you want to prove the Goldbach theorem to impress her.<br/>
You come up with an idea:<br/>
The %1$s\'s number!<br/>
The %1$s\'s number is the number of combinations to build an even number out of two prime summands.<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
%1$s(4) = 1 (2+2)<br/>
%1$s(6) = 1 (3+3)<br/>
%1$s(8) = 1 (3+5)<br/>
%1$s(10) = 2 (3+7, 5+5)<br/>
%1$s(12) = 1 (5+7)<br/>
<br/>
You analyze a bigger set of numbers to work on your proof...<br/>
<br/>
The solution to this challenge is a hash.<br/>
Concatenate all %1$s\'s numbers from 4 to 31415926 as a string, and build the md5 hash out of it.<br/>
<br/>
In the example above, from 4 to 12, the solution would be md5(\'11121\');<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice Valentine\'s Day<br/>
